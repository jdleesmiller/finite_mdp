# The computations are carried out on an intermediate form of the given model,
# which is stored using nested arrays:
#   model[state_num][action_num] = [[next_state_num, probability, reward], ...]
# The solver assigns numbers to each state and each action automatically. Note
# that the successor state data are stored in sparse format, and any transitions
# that are in the given model but have zero probability are not stored.

# TODO maybe implement a 'dense' storage format for models with many successor
